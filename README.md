## Welcome to Tick Tock Toe. 

This is a speed tick tack toe game where the user finishes as many tick tack toes as they can before the timer runs out. You can set your username and keep track of your high scores. After entering the game, the 60 second timer will start automatically. After every move you make, the computer will make a move 1/10th of a second after you. Your score will increase by 1 every time you win a game. To restart the game, simply refresh the page.
